title: About
---

I'm Jonathan - A senior backend engineer with a passion for tech and software. I have 9 years of experience in the industry, 2 in DevOps and 7 as a Backend developer.

I started my journey as a DevOps engineer focusing on cloud, containers and Linux servers. From there I moved to a Backend developer role with an emphasis on building and leading features end to end.

My experience goes from setting up cloud infrastructure and CI/CD, to backend architectures all the way to the UI and the end user. This puts me in a unique position to be able to develop and contribute accross the entire spectrum of a software product, all for the sake of seeing the product come to life.
