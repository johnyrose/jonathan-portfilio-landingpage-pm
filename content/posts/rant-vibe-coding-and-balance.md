title: 'Rant: Vibe coding and finding balance'
---

If you followed AI news in the last 2 years, you'd probably see whole waves of sentiment changes. Around a year ago, maybe a bit less, we saw the peek of "vibe coding influencers" - you'd see a ton of posts across social media about full apps vibe coded with Cursor making 50k/month, companies pushing people to vibe code or get fired and all that. As time went on, the con started to get exposed, and we are now seeing the peek of anti-vibe-coding. It's now acceptable to talk about how AI is actually bad at programming, how much it's completely useless and makes devs slower. 

As always, humans suck at finding the balance. The truth is, of course, annoyingly in the middle. AI *does* in fact improve your productivity. It takes away the boring parts of programming and lets you focus more in the interesting ones, and if you're working on real development tasks - using AI in the appropriate places in a good pace can actually speed tasks quite significantly without hurting the quality. If anything, it can help you add more tests and write better quality software. But if you try to get AI to write everything for you, and you only move to reviewing its code, you are not only shipping bad code, but making yourself a worse developer in the long run.

Why is finding the proper balance so hard for people?
